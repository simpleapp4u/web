      The sync feature allows you to store information in your own iCloud account. Apple iCloud can store any private
      data from our apps to sync and backup.
      Using iCloud means that your information is no longer only on one device but accessible from multiple places.
      Multiple access points can make your
      information more accessible and therefore, more vulnerable. If someone knew your Apple ID or your iCloud
      username/password, they might be able to access your data and information.

      Our apps uses Apple analytics service to get crash logs so that the developer can fix bugs. Anonymous statistics
      for example about a certain crash that
      happens often on a certain device kind after a certain action is provided to the developer which helps finding the
      bug and fixing the crash. Apple analytics
      also provide data about how many users visited our store pages, how many users went on and download our app, how
      many remained active over time and other not
      personalized data. You can allow or deny to share the analytics data in the iOS settings.
